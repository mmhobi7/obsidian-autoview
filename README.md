# Obsidian AutoView Plugin

This is a plugin for Obsidian (https://obsidian.md).

This plugin will auto-switch the active window to edit mode when a keystroke is detected, and then switch back to preview mode a delay after the last keystroke is detected. This quick switching allows for a kind of WYSIWYG.

## Installation

1. Install the plugin via the community plugins settings tab in Obsidian.

## Settings

* Timeout Duration: The amount of time in seconds that the plugin waits after the last keystroke before swtiching over to preview mode.
* Scroll back to previous editing location: Whether the editor should scroll back to it's previous location when switching from edit to preview mode (verus just auto scrolling to where editing is happening)
